Music and Mental Health EDA
================================

This Analysis is based on a survey for the assessment of the link between listening to music and different mental 
health issues

Context
================================
Music therapy, or MT, is the use of music to improve an individual's stress, mood, and overall mental health. MT is also
recognized as an evidence-based practice, using music as a catalyst for "happy" hormones such as oxytocin.

However, MT employs a wide range of different genres, varying from one organization to the next.

The MxMH dataset aims to identify what, if any, correlations exist between an individual's music taste and their 
self-reported mental health. Ideally, these findings could contribute to a more informed application of MT or simply 
provide interesting sights about the mind.

Data collection
================================
Data collection was managed by @catherinerasgaitis via a Google Form. Respondents were not restricted by age or location.
The form was posted in various Reddit forums, Discord servers, and social media platforms. Posters and "business cards"
were also used to advertise the form in libraries, parks, and other public locations.
The form was relatively brief so that respondents would be more likely finish the survey. "Harder" questions (such as BPM)
were left optional for the same reason.
